Syntax
~~~~~~

(define (P V*) E*)

define procedure P with formal parameters V* and body expressions E*

(define-data T (C Ci*)+)

define a new datatype  T with constructors C and selectors Ci. the
elements of T may be partially static.

(define-type (P B*) B)

define the type of a procedure which is subject to
specialization. useful to generalize arguments.

(define-primitive (O B*) B)

define the type of an operator (or external procedure). admits the
special binding-time description "-" which prescribes that the
respective argument/result is unrelated to the others (i.e. it is not
equated to the remaining args and it is not related to S). for example

	(deftype (eval * *) -) 

means that the first and second arguments are equated and that S is
leq than they; the result is unconstrained (i.e., may be a function);
however, if any argument or the result becomes dynamic the others are
made dynamic, too.
